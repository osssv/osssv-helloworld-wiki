-Or, well, in a few of times in any case. The time is almost on us! One of the most intimate occasions of year.2nd only to  [[Tim mcgraw tour jiffy lube>http://www.melbournebizdirectory.com/author/concertticketsonline38/]] Valentine's Working day (or, if you're me, the 4th of July).
 
-The El Rey is a little theatre in Los Angeles, on La Cienaga. It has a really awesome artwork deco environment. The balcony is a cozy environment with couches. There is a extremely big, rectangular flooring area. A couple of steps up there is a level surrounding the flooring with chairs and a few tables. It's nothing fancy, but it is a "kick-back again and relax" kind of location to see a show. We have noticed mostly local bands play here, but it is generally a great display. The bar is not that expensive both, although they do not have the best selection. There is generally totally free road parking in the common vicinity of the theatre, but you might have to walk a block or two. If all else fails, there's valet.
