-The Avalon is located on Vine Road, right in the heart of downtown Hollywood. It is correct around the corner from the Pantages theatre.

-The night exhibits at the Aurora Theatre had been a combine of the ship's own crew of dancers and singers plus some outside comics and singers. In general, the exhibits were quite great. We would have liked them to mix up the enjoyment each evening instead than allocate music, comedy and magic into various evenings. Instead than an entire display of magic, we would have preferred each evening that includes a selection of entertainment. Live Music about the ship was a good additional touch.
