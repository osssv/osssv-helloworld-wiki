 *Overall Feature [#i666077d]
 >Ruby Version Manager, often abbreviated as RVM, is a unix-like software platform designed to manage multiple installations of Ruby on the same device.
 The entire ruby environment including the Ruby interpreter, installed RubyGems, and documentation is partitioned. The different versions can then be switched between to enable a developer to work on several projects with different version requirements.
