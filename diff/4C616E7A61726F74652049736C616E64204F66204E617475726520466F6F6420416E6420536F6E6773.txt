There is a fairly large front floor region, and then a little raised region in  [[ed sheeran Tour louisville>http://www.cheltenhamvip.co.uk/search-offers/author/ticketsonline65/]] the back again with the bar. It is usually overcrowded and I find that the staff associates are usually impolite. It is possible to be a safety guard and not be impolite. For the most part, this is a 21 and up club, although many exhibits are all ages.
